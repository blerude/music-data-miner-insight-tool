# StreamTrack Analytics Engine

## Overview

This analytics tool pulls from the public playlists in the Spotify catalog to provide a comprehensive look at 
which artists and songs are being pushed hardest by the streaming service. This industry-level insight gives 
labels, managers, and artists an idea for where there music can be found. Information like the position of a 
certain track on a playlist (is it the first song that people naturally click on, or is it at the bottom and 
therefore mostly ignored?) or the popularity of that track at a given point in time can tell these professionals
just how to market their act, or whether they need to push for more space on the platform. 

The engine is not yet live and is a work in progress--there are more features and functionalities to come.
